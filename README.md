# K-means-on-Abalon-data-set
K-means algorithm is the most popular and yet simplest of all the clustering algorithms.  Select the number of clusters k that you think is the optimal number. Initialize k points as "centroids" randomly within the space of our data. Attribute each observation to its closest centroid. Update the centroids to the center of all the attributed set of observations. Repeat steps 3 and 4 a fixed number of times or until all of the centroids are stable (i.e. no longer change in step 4). This algorithm is easy to describe and visualize. Let's take a look.
